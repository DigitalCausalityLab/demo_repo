### Participants

- [ ] Please list the names and GitHub user names here

### Abstract

- [ ] Insert a brief description of the goals and results of your case study (around 250 words, English)
- [ ] You can upload and include figures, too

### Current State and Call for Extension

- [ ] Briefly summarize the state of your data product as of the end of the course
- [ ] Briefly summarize what could be added or improved in the future


## Organization of the Repo

We'd recommend you to organize your repo as follows.

* Include figures (`.jpg`, `.png`, ...) in a subdirectory called `figures/`, see [this example](figures/logo.png)
* Include data files (`.csv`, `.rda`, ...) in a subdirectory called `data/`, see [this example](data/experiment_data_counterfactual.rda)
* Include your R code (`.R` files) in a subdirectory called `R`, see [this example](R/my_function.R)
* In case you use quarto for your data product, include your `.qmd` files here, see [this example](demo_repo.qmd)

These basic recommendations are intended to give you a bit structure. You can deviate from them as you like but please make sure others should be able to understand what you did. ðŸ˜„
