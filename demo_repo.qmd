## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).


## Include figures

You can also include some figures, for example 

![](figures/logo.png){width=50%}


## Load data 

You can load data using relative paths. Here we load data from the subdirectory `data`

```{r}
load("data/experiment_data_counterfactual.rda")
head(df)
```


## Load R code 


```{r}
# Load the R code in the file `R/my_function.R"
source("R/my_function.R")

set.seed(1234)
x <- draw(10)
print(x)
```
